        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 1</h2>
        <p class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:<br>Caesar returns to Rome after a recent victory, however two tribunes named Flavius and Marullus are 
            concerned about the sway Caesar has over the people of Rome. They argue with a cobbler and carpenter over this, and state that Caesar's 
            growing influence is troubling. They remove decorations from Caesar's statues to try and diminish his appearance.</p>
        <p class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:<br>Both Flavius and Marullus express heavy concern over Caesar's growing power. 
            This is evidenced through Flavius's line of "These growing feathers plucked from Caesarâ€™s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch 
            (Lines 77-78)," which expresses a desire to tear down Caesar. Marullus has a similar line in which he states "O you hard hearts, you 
            cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey? (Lines 41-42)," showing him scold the people of Rome for changing loyalty from Pompey
            to Caesar so easily. Flavius's line of "Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies. (Line 69-70)," also 
            shows how he and Marullus look to manipulate the people of Rome by deglorifying Caesar.</p>

    <div class="analysisCard" id="act1scene2">
        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 2</h2>
        <p class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:<br>Caesar, his wife Calpurnia, Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius attend a Roman festival. While the crowd is preparing
        to celebrate, a soothsayer warns Caesar to "beware the Ideas of March." Caesar dismisses the soothsayer, but this is foreshadowing for his
        coming assassination. After Caesar leaves, Cassius is left alone with Brutus and questions him about his feelings towards Caesar's rise to 
        power. Brutus admits he is concerned. Cassius then flatters Brutus and says that Caesar is weak and doesn't deserve his god-like status, as 
        evidenced by when he fell sick in Spain or needed rescuing from the Tiver river. Brutus isn't fully convinced, but the seeds of doubt are sown within him.</p>
