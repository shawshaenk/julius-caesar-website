        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar returns to Rome after a recent victory, however two tribunes named Flavius and Marullus are 
            concerned about the sway Caesar has over the people of Rome. They argue with a cobbler and carpenter over this, and state that Caesar's 
            growing influence is troubling. They remove decorations from Caesar's statues to try and diminish his appearance.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Both Flavius and Marullus express heavy concern over Caesar's growing power. 
            This is evidenced through Flavius's line of "These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch (Lines 77-78)," 
            which expresses a desire to tear down Caesar. Marullus has a similar line in which he states "O you hard hearts, you 
            cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey? (Lines 41-42)," showing him scold the people of Rome for changing loyalty from Pompey
            to Caesar so easily. Flavius's line of "Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies (Line 69-70)," also 
            shows how he and Marullus look to manipulate the people of Rome by deglorifying Caesar.</p>

        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 2</h2>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar, his wife Calpurnia, Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius attend a Roman festival. Caesar tells
        Antony, who is about to run a race for the festival, to touch Calpurnia as he runs by as it was believed to cure infertility. While the crowd is preparing
        to celebrate, a soothsayer warns Caesar to "beware the Ideas of March." Caesar dismisses the soothsayer, but this is foreshadowing for his
        coming assassination. After Caesar leaves, Cassius is left alone with Brutus and questions him about his feelings towards Caesar's rise to 
        power. Brutus admits he is concerned. Cassius then flatters Brutus and says that Caesar is weak and doesn't deserve his god-like status, as 
        evidenced by when he fell sick in Spain or needed rescuing from the Tiver river. Brutus isn't fully convinced, but the seeds of doubt are sown within him.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar, upon hearing the soothsayer's warning, dismisses him saying " He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass
            (Line 29)," displaying how he perceives himself as invulnerable and doesn't take such warning seriously. As for Antony, he is displayed as loyal to Caesar, 
            saying " When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed (Line 14)." Cassius is portrayed as sly and manipulative, as shown through him manipulating
            Brutus with the quotes "Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,
            Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes (Line 65)." Finally, Brutus is portrayed as conflicted and hesitant, as shown by his line "I shall recount hereafter
            (Line 174)."</p>

        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 3</h2>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Casca and Cicero meet on a street. Casca expresses concern about the bad omens he saw throughout the day such as a man with
            his hands on fire but not burning, a lion near the capital that ignored him, men on fire walking in the streets, and an owl in the marketplace during the day. 
            Cicero dismisses these omens however as misinterpretations. Cicero asks if Caesar is coming to the capital that day, to which Casca says yes. Cassius enters and 
            says the Gods are using these omens to warn the Romans about their bad government. Casca tells Cassius that the Senate plans to make Caesar king the following day, 
            and Cassius points his dagger to the sky and says that if they can make a weak man like Caesar power, they can make Cassius powerful enough to defeat Caesar. 
            Casca agrees with Cassius, and Casca says that he has convinced other people to turn against Caesar, like Cinna. Cassius says his next goal is to turn Brutus against 
            Caesar in order to look good in front of the public as Brutus has a good reputation. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Casca is shown as superstitious and anxious, as shown by his quote "Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
            Shakes like a thing unfirm? (Lines 3-4)." Cicero is depicted as rational and pragmatic, as shown by his quote "But men may construe things after their fashion
            (Line 34)." Cassius is once again shown to be manipulative and malicious, evidenced by his attempts to badmouth Caesar: "And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?
            Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep (Lines 107-109)."</p>

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus is troubled an unable to sleep. He paces in his orchard and reasons with himself, thinking that while Caesar doesn't
            seem corrupt yet, he's like a "serpent's egg," which if allowed to hatch, would become dangerous. Therefore, he concludes Caesar must be killed while still in the shell.
            Later, Brutus's servant brings Brutus a letter planted by Cassius near a window. It was designed to manipulate Brutus into thinking that it was his duty to Rome to remove
            Caesar from power. Later, all the conspirators (Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonius) visit Brutus cloaked. Brutus agrees to kill Caesar, but doesn't accept
            Cassius's offered oath. They consider adding Cicero to the plan and killing Mark Antony, both of which are decided against. A plan is made to lure Caesar out of his home
            the next day for the assassination. Portia enters and begs Brutus to tell her what happened, but he refuses. Brutus remains conflicted about his decision. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus is portrayed as a highly honorable and stoic man, loyal to Rome and but morally conflicted. This is shown by his line
            "It must be by his death. And for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general (Lines 10-12)." Cassius is portrayed as jealous and spiteful of
            Caesar's power, and continues to flatter and manipulate Brutus. Portia is shown to be strong willed and intelligent, shown by her lines "I have made strong proof of my 
            constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here, in the thigh (Lines 322-324)."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="analysisCard" id="act2scene2">

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar is restless because of Calpurnia's nightmare about his murder and the various bad omens she saw such as a lioness
            giving birth in the streets and dead men walking. She starts begging him to stay home and not go to the senate. However, Decius arrives and convinces Caesar that
            Calpurnia's dream actually meant he would give life to Rome, and that he should go the Senate. In the end, Caesar's desire to keep up the facade that he's invincible 
            and all-powerful makes him ignore the omens and still go to the senate. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar is portrayed as torn between his safety and public image, and eventually chooses his public image. This is shown by
            him dismissing the augur's warnings by saying "Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once (Lines 34-35)." Calpurnia is shown
            to be incredibly loyal and concerned for her husband, evidenced by her quote "When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of
            princes (Lines 31-33)." Finally, Decius is shown to be a cunning manipulator like Cassius, twisting Caesar's perception of the dream by saying "This dream is all amiss 
            interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate (Lines 88-90)."

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Artemidorus, a new character, reads out a letter he has written that warns Caesar about the conspiracy against him. The letter
            specifically names Brutus and the other conspirators. He plans to give the letter to Caesar as he makes his way to the senate. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Artemidorus is portrayed as perceptive and courageous, willing to take initiative to warn Caesar about the plans against him, 
            stating in his letter "Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber (Lines 1-3)."

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Portia is overwhelmed with anxiety and is conflicted between supporting Brutus's conspiracy and being concerned for Caesar's 
            safety. She also struggles to keep the conspiracy a secret. The soothsayer also appears in the scene showing concern over Caesar's safety and expresses
            a desire to warn him again. Portia sends her servant Lucius to the capital.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Portia was portrayed as strong-willed previously however the conflict she experiences contradicts that original
            portrayal, evidenced through the quote "I have a man’s mind but a woman’s might (Line 9)."

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar arrives in the senate despite numerous warnings against doing so. Metellus approaches Caesar and begs for the reversal
            of his brother's banishment. Other senators join Metellus, and tension flare. Eventually, Casca stabs Caesar and all the other conspirators follow, including Brutus. 
            The conspirators then bathe their hands in Caesar's blood, marking the overthrow of his rule.
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar is portrayed as powerful and arrogant, ignoring the soothsayer's and Artemidorus's warnings. He also says to Metellus that
            he is "constant as the Northern Star (Line 66)," showing Caesar's superiority complex. This arrogance is what eventually led to his assassination, which could have easily 
            been avoided.

    <div class="analysisCard" id="act3scene2">
        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 2</h2>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">After Caesar's assassination, Brutus addresses the Roman public claiming that he loved Caesar but had to kill him in order to 
            prevent him from becoming a tyrant and destroying Rome. The crowd initially believed him, but then Mark Antony gave his own speech afterwards. He sarcastically called 
            Brutus honorable while questioning what evidence the conspirators had that Caesar was a tyrant. He then cited examples of Caesar being a good person by refusing a crown
            thrice and weeping for the poor. The crowd then questioned Brutus's motives and turned against the conspirators.
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus is portrayed as rational and argues for reason in justifying his killing of Caesar, stating "Censure me in your wisdom,
            and awake your senses that you may the better judge (Lines 17-19)." Antony meanwhile is shown to be an emotion manipulator of the public, saying things such as "My heart 
            is in the coffin there with Caesar (Line 116)," and weeping afterwards to get the crowd to favor his argument over Brutus's, which he does successfully.</p>

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Cinna the poet is on his way to Caesar's funeral when a mob of plebians, riled up by Antony's speech, confronts him. Even knowing
            that he wasn't Cinna the conspirator, just for having the same name, the mob attacks Cinna the Poet, justifying it by saying he has bad poetry.
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">This scene serves to show the capacity that Rome's citizens have for violence and how they are easily swayed and manipulated
            by just one speech.

        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus are at Antony's house. The three of them now share equal thirds of power over Rome. 
            They discuss who to execute as part of political purges. Lepidus agrees to the execution of his brother and Antony agrees to the execution of his nephew. 
            Antony then tells Lepidus to get Caesar's will to see if the funds he donated to the public could be funnelled back to them. As Lepidus gets the will, 
            Antony calls Lepidus a tool and an animal. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Antony in this scene is portrayed as power hungry and selfish, willing to kill his own family members for power and 
            badmouthing his allies. This is supported by his statement "This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands (Lines 14-15)," where he badmouths Lepidus.

        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus and Cassius are in an army camp near Sardis. Here, Brutus, Lucius, Lucilius, and other soldiers meet with Titinius 
            and Pindarus. Brutus expresses to Lucilius that Cassius is not to be trusted and Cassius has become too insincere and overly polite. Upon Cassius's arrival, 
            Cassius accuses Brutus of wrondoing, to which Brutus denies, calling Cassius his "brother." They have their discussion privately away from everyone else.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus is still committed to morality and nobility, which is why he's so concered with Cassius being dishonorable. Cassius
            is still portrayed as cunning and manipulative, making Brutus doubt his authority/loyalty through the quote "Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs (Line 44)."
        </p>

        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Cassius and Brutus argue about how Brutus condemned a man for taking bribes while Cassius defended the man. Brutus accuses
            Cassius of being corrupt and taking bribes himself. Cassius offers his dagger to Brutus saying to kill him if he's truly being dishonorable, but Brutus diffuses the situation.
            Brutus reveals that his wife Portia had committed suicide and they then discuss their military strategy against Antony and Octavius.
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Brutus still demonstrates an unwavering moral code as evidenced by his scolding of Cassius in the quote "But for supporting robbers, shall we now
            Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors (Lines 24-26)." Cassius is also still portrayed as manipulative, putting Brutus
            in a difficult situation by offering his dagger to Brutus to kill him if he thinks he's really being immoral, forcing Brutus to deescalate the situation.</p>

            to avenge Caesar's death. Meanwhile, Cassius reveals to Messala that he saw bad omens. Brutus and Cassius discuss suicide, and Brutus strongly opposes it. Brutus and Cassius
