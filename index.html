        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar returns to Rome after a recent victory, however two tribunes named Flavius and Marullus are 
            concerned about the sway Caesar has over the people of Rome. They argue with a cobbler and carpenter over this, and state that Caesar's 
            growing influence is troubling. They remove decorations from Caesar's statues to try and diminish his appearance.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Both Flavius and Marullus express heavy concern over Caesar's growing power. 
            This is evidenced through Flavius's line of "These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch (Lines 77-78)," 
            which expresses a desire to tear down Caesar. Marullus has a similar line in which he states "O you hard hearts, you 
            cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey? (Lines 41-42)," showing him scold the people of Rome for changing loyalty from Pompey
            to Caesar so easily. Flavius's line of "Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies (Line 69-70)," also 
            shows how he and Marullus look to manipulate the people of Rome by deglorifying Caesar.</p>

    <div class="analysisCard" id="act1scene2">
        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 2</h2>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar, his wife Calpurnia, Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius attend a Roman festival. Caesar tells
        Antony, who is about to run a race for the festival, to touch Calpurnia as he runs by as it was believed to cure infertility. While the crowd is preparing
        to celebrate, a soothsayer warns Caesar to "beware the Ideas of March." Caesar dismisses the soothsayer, but this is foreshadowing for his
        coming assassination. After Caesar leaves, Cassius is left alone with Brutus and questions him about his feelings towards Caesar's rise to 
        power. Brutus admits he is concerned. Cassius then flatters Brutus and says that Caesar is weak and doesn't deserve his god-like status, as 
        evidenced by when he fell sick in Spain or needed rescuing from the Tiver river. Brutus isn't fully convinced, but the seeds of doubt are sown within him.</p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Caesar, upon hearing the soothsayer's warning, dismisses him saying " He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass
            (Line 29)," displaying how he perceives himself as invulnerable and doesn't take such warning seriously. As for Antony, he is displayed as loyal to Caesar, 
            saying " When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed (Line 14)." Cassius is portrayed as sly and manipulative, as shown through him manipulating
            Brutus with the quotes "Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,
            Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes (Line 65)." Finally, Brutus is portrayed as conflicted and hesitant, as shown by his line "I shall recount hereafter
            (Line 174)."</p>

    <div class="analysisCard" id="act1scene3">
        <h2 class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextTitle">Scene 3</h2>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Scene Summary:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Casca and Cicero meet on a street. Casca expresses concern about the bad omens he saw throughout the day such as a man with
            his hands on fire but not burning, a lion near the capital that ignored him, men on fire walking in the streets, and an owl in the marketplace during the day. 
            Cicero dismisses these omens however as misinterpretations. Cicero asks if Caesar is coming to the capital that day, to which Casca says yes. Cassius enters and 
            says the Gods are using these omens to warn the Romans about their bad government. Casca tells Cassius that the Senate plans to make Caesar king the following day, 
            and Cassius points his dagger to the sky and says that if they can make a weak man like Caesar power, they can make Cassius powerful enough to defeat Caesar. 
            Casca agrees with Cassius, and Casca says that he has convinced other people to turn against Caesar, like Cinna. Cassius says his next goal is to turn Brutus against 
            Caesar in order to look good in front of the public as Brutus has a good reputation. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="analysisCardText">Character Analysis:</h3>
        <p class="analysisCardText analysisCardTextP">Casca is shown as superstitious and anxious, as shown by his quote "Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
            Shakes like a thing unfirm? (Lines 3-4)." Cicero is depicted as rational and pragmatic, as shown by his quote "But men may construe things after their fashion
            (Line 34)." Cassius is once again shown to be manipulative and malicious, evidenced by his attempts to badmouth Caesar: "And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?
            Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep (Lines 107-109)."</p>
